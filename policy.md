# Slack Policy

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the Work on Blockchain "WOB" slack channel is to

* Allow participants to learn blockchain technology development from each other
* Communicate with each other throughout and after WOB events and workshops
* Hear about work opportunities that WOB can facilitate

We are passionate about educating blockchain developers for FREE or as cheaply as possible and we have built a recruitment platform so that we can cover these costs.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

To make this possible we need your help. Those that participate in our slack channel are bound to the same terms as our platform:
Talent looking for work: https://workonblockchain.com/pages/candidate-terms
Hiring companies: https://workonblockchain.com/pages/company-terms

## Please
If you are approached by someone who is making offers for paid or unpaid work please get in touch with an administrator immediately. This helps keep our community safe from harrasment and allows us to teach blockchain for free.

Administrators:

 * Antonio Sabado (CEO)
 * Jack Tanner (CTO)
